# Write_At_Your_Own_Risk
if you stop writing you lose your work. :)

## The Challenge
The rules are simple but brutal:
- You start typing.
- If you pause for **5 seconds**, the screen fades.
- Once the timer hits zero, all your text is cleared.
- The goal? Get your thoughts out without overthinking.

## 🛠️ Custom Logic & Features
While the visual layout is based on an HTML5 UP template, I have heavily modified the project to include custom JavaScript and CSS functionality:
- **The Death Timer:** Custom JS logic that tracks keyboard inactivity.
- **Dynamic Fading Effect:** A CSS-linked opacity algorithm that makes the text disappear as the timer reaches zero.
- **Responsive Layout:** Adjusted the original "Spotlight" panels to center the focus on the writing experience.
- **Auto-Reset:** A hard-coded reset function to clear the DOM upon failure.



## 📈 Learning Journey
This project is part of my learning journey to learn web development. It allowed me to practice:
1. Handling real-time user input events in JavaScript.
2. Managing state (timers) and DOM manipulation.
3. Hosting and deploying via GitHub Pages.
