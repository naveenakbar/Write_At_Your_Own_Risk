# The Dangerous Writer ✍️🔥

A high-stakes writing app where you lose everything if you stop typing.

## How it Works
- You have **5 seconds** to keep writing.
- If the timer hits **0**, your text is deleted forever.
- The screen starts to **fade** when you have less than 2 seconds left!

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 / CSS3 (Sass)
- jQuery (for timer logic and fading effects)
- Template by HTML5 UP
